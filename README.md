# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.  The issue arises when the request body is either empty or contains invalid JSON data, causing the server to fail to parse the body correctly. This leads to unexpected behavior, such as `req.body` being undefined or containing unexpected data.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file shows a basic Express.js server that attempts to parse JSON request bodies using `express.json()`. However, if a POST request is made to `/data` with an empty body or a body that's not valid JSON, the server will not correctly handle the request.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem. By adding error handling to check for `req.body` validity before processing it, the application can prevent crashes and handle these cases gracefully. This involves explicitly checking if `req.body` is undefined or empty before accessing its properties.  The improved version also includes better logging to aid in debugging.
